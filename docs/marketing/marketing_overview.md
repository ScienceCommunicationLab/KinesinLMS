# Marketing Overview

KinesinLMS comes with some basic 'marketing' pages preconfigured, but you'll probably want to update these pages
to match your institution, goals, and so on.

Some pages, like Terms of Service, About Us, Contact and Privacy Policy *definitely* should be updated.

Here are the 'marketing' pages for the site:

- About Us
- Contact
- FAQ 
- Get Started : A page that provides some basic tips on how a user can get started on the site.
- Testimonials
- Terms of Service
- Privacy Policy

For most pages, you can update them by just changing their HTML directly. You can locate their template in the `templates/marketing` folder.

Some marketing features, like testimonials, are modified via the admin panel. More on that next.
