# Testimonials

User testimonials must be entered in the admin panel, as they are stored in the system database.

There are two types of testimonials:

- "Site" testimonials that are more generic in nature and don't reference a particular course.
- "Course" testimonials that pertain to a particular course.

You can add and configure a testimonial using the Django admin panel [/admin/marketing/testimonial/](/admin/marketing/testimonial/)

Note that testimonials have a 'visible' property that you can use to control which testimonials are shown
to the user.
