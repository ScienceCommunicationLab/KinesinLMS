# Deployment Overview

KinesinLMS is a Django app that can be hosted on any Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that supports Django, such as Heroku,
Fly.io or Render.com. It can also be hosted on your own custom-built server or platform!

These instructions will describe setting up on Heroku, but the basic steps are the same for any PaaS.
