# Survey Overview

Integrating surveys into a course can help provide vital information about learning outcomes, as well
help you improve the overall user experience by providing user feedback. Structured survey data can be particularly
helpful if the course is part of a formal research effort.

There are a number of companies that offer survey authoring and hosting. KinesinLMS provides a simple integration with
the [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) service to render surveys directly in a course unit, and to track survey completions via
Qualtrics web service calls. Unfortunately, KinesinLMS does not support other survey providers is supported at
the moment...therefore this section focused on integrating surveys constructed in Qualtrics, including how to
link the survey to a student via a 'uid' identifier.

(Having said that, other survey providers could probably be supported without too much effort.)

So read on if you want to learn how to create a survey in Qualtrics and integrate it into a KinesinLMS course.
