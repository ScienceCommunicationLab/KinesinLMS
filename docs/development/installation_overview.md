# Development Overview

KinesinLMS is a Django application implemented using the conventions established by
the (most excellent) [Cookiecutter Django](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django)
project.

So setting it up is similar to setting up any Django project built from Django cookiecutter, but with a few extra
steps. This section describes how you can get started with KinesinLMS in your local environment, including
both setting up the project and then doing thing like running tests.
