# Course Overview

A "course" in KinesinLMS is a series of "Units." A unit is essentially one web page of content.

Each unit is composed of multiple content "blocks," which can have different types of content: videos,
html text, assessments and so on. This is essentially how most LMS applications are set up. (A student might
not notice that a unit is made up of blocks...for them the set of blocks in a unit appear as one web page.)

Units in a course are organized into "Sections," which are further grouped in "Modules." This grouping provides
students with a logical content structure and a method of navigation. It also allows you the author to
segment portions of course content according to various rules (e.g. content in Module 2 is not
available until a certain date).

When you author a course in the Composer tool, you'll build up your modules, sections and units and then
add content to each unit by adding one or more blocks.

Other aspects of the course, such as enrollment open date or course start date, are also configured in Composer.
