# Blocks

Blocks are types of content you add to a Unit. When you author a course in Composer, you
build up each unit's content by adding various blocks and arranging them so they appear in the right
order when the unit web page is shown the user.

KinesinLMS only has a small set of block types at the moment, but we hope to create more type in the future
to support different kinds of learning interactions.

Current block types include the following:

  - "HTML content" : A simple block to hold HTML content. Composer provides a rich editor if you don't want to write HTML code by hand.
  - "Video" : Display a video in a video player. (Currently only YouTube is supported.)
  - "File Resource": Allows you to display a file to a user for download.
  - "Callout": A simple content block that provides a bit of graphical treatment to highlight the content.
  - "Assessment": A block that provides an assessment to the user: text entry, multiple choice, etc.
  - "Forum Topic": Provides a link to a forum topic in the remote forum provider. (Shows some of the recent entries from the topic to encourage engagement.)
  - "Survey": Display a survey from the survey provider directly in the unit.
  - "Simple Interative tool": Displays an interactive activity.
  - "External Tool" (IN DEVELOPMENT): Displays an external e-Learning tool via the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard.
