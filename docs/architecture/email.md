# Email

Emails are sent in a couple different ways and for a couple different purposes.
KinesinLMS uses the basic email feature that comes with Django for system emails
and for some course-specific tasks, like reminding students to fill out surveys.

For more complex emails and email automations, KinesinLMS relies on a provider,
like ActiveCampaign.
