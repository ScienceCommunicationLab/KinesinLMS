"""
The 'forum' module is basically concerned with managing the integration
with the external forum provider.

In the future, we may want to switch to having our own, simple forum and get
rid of the complexity introduced by using an external forum provider like Discourse.

However, for now, our first and only integration is with Discourse as it's feature-rich
and works well for our needs (and it's free for open-source projects).
