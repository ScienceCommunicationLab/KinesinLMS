Templates for HTMx-based Assessment Components
-----------------------------------------------

As assessment components are migrated from React to HTMx, the HTML template should be placed in this folder.

NOTE: Template names should be the same as the Assessment type enum, only lowercase.

For example, the DONE_INDICATOR type should be done_indicator.html
